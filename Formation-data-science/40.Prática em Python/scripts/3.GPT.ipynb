      "\n",
      "2. Inflation risk: Inflation can erode the purchasing power of the fixed interest payments received from Treasury securities. If inflation rises higher than the interest rate earned on the securities, the real return can be negative.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Reinvestment risk: When a Treasury security matures or is called before its maturity date, investors may need to reinvest the proceeds at a lower interest rate if market rates have declined. This can impact the overall return on the investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Credit risk: U.S. Treasury securities are considered to have minimal credit risk since they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. However, there can still be risks associated with the possibility of default if the government were unable to meet its debt obligations.\n",
      "\n",
